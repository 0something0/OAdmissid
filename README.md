# HS-Inequality

## Active Work In Progress!!!
Far From Functional (yet)

This website seeks to be a way for high schoolers across North America and elsewhere to compare the inequalities they face in the college admissions process. The goal is for students to simply upload the data from their high school from Naviance, Maialearning, etc and compare with other schools.
